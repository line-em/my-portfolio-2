				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>
					I'm Aline, a <strong>front-end developer</strong> currently based on Portugal,
					building web applications using React. I'm looking forward to be part of a team
					that puts together creative solutions to all sorts of problems! I love
					delivering good user interfaces and I'm ready to tackle more challenges!
					{/* focusing on responsiveness and other things! As of now, I work as
					an designer/illustrator, but I'm looking forward to a career change! */}
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm a hard worker and eager to learn more. I'm looking for more knowledge and
					for a chance to contribute in a real project, if you give me a chance.
